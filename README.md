# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
- This project centers on sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral based on text content. A dataset of tweets with corresponding sentiments was sourced and preprocessed to remove noise, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, and cleansing URLs and special characters. The text was vectorized using TF-IDF, converting it into numerical features.
- Multiple classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes — were implemented and evaluated. Each model's performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with Logistic Regression emerging as the top performer due to its highest accuracy and balanced precision-recall values.
- Visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn were utilized to graphically represent data distributions and model performance, aiding in understanding the dataset's demographic aspects and comparing classifier efficiencies.
- In conclusion, this project showcases the successful application of machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of tweets, providing a robust framework for understanding public sentiment on Twitter. Future work could explore larger, more diverse datasets, advanced natural language processing techniques, and model fine-tuning for improved performance.
