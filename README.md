# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
- This project focuses on analyzing tweet sentiments using machine learning to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. A dataset of tweets with labeled sentiments was collected and cleaned by removing noise, such as punctuation, URLs, special characters, and converting text to lowercase. The preprocessed text was transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

- Several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes, were implemented and assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Logistic Regression demonstrated the best performance with the highest accuracy and well-balanced precision-recall values.

- Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to illustrate data distributions and compare model performance, enhancing the understanding of both the dataset and classifier effectiveness.

- This project successfully applies machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis, offering a framework for gauging public opinion on Twitter. Future improvements could include leveraging larger and more diverse datasets, exploring advanced NLP techniques, and fine-tuning models for enhanced performance.
